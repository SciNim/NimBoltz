* NimBoltz

A simple interfacer to [[https://magboltz.web.cern.ch/magboltz/][MagBoltz]], a program that solves the Boltzmann
transport equations for electrons in gas mixtures given external
electric and magnetic fields. It is one of the most fundamental
programs in gaseous detector physics to simulate properties of gases
used in gaseous detectors.

It requires ~magboltz~ as a binary somewhere in your PATH. See
[[Installing Magboltz]] below if you're unsure about how.

What this library allows you to do is to avoid having to manually
write the extremely pedantic Magboltz input files. An example for a
Magboltz input looks as follows:

#+begin_src
2         1         1         1         0.00000   
2    11   80   80   80   80   
97.7000   2.3000    0.0000    0.0000    0.0000    0.0000    26.8500   787.5648  
60000.000 0.000     0.000     
0         0         0         0         0.00000   
#+end_src

Nice right?

Further, if you define multiple gas mixtures / settings this library
will run multiple Magboltz processes for you in parallel, so you don't
have to manually start N processes each with their own input and
output file names. The file names are created based on the used
parameters.

** Using this library

Of interest is mainly the ~initMagboltz~ procedure:
#+begin_src nim
proc initMagboltz*[F: SomeUnit, P: Pressure](
  gases: seq[Gas], pressure: P, temp: Kelvin, E: F,
  nMax: int,
  usePenning = true, gasMotionThermal = true,
  B: Tesla = 0.T,
  Bθ: Degree = 0.°,
  eFinal = 0.0,
  outpath = "resources"
                                          ): Magboltz
#+end_src
with which you construct a ~Magboltz~ object, which stores the gases
and settings for a calculation. The gases come from either ~initGas~
or ~initGases~:

#+begin_src nim
proc initGas*(id: int, fraction: float): Gas =
  let gM = getGas(id)
  result = Gas(name: gM.name, id: gM.id, frac: fraction)

proc initGas*(name: string, fraction: float): Gas =
  let gM = getGas(name)
  result = Gas(name: gM.name, id: gM.id, frac: fraction)

proc initGases*[T: int | string](gases: varargs[(T, float)]): seq[Gas] =
  for arg in gases:
    result.add initGas(arg[0], arg[1])
#+end_src
where as you can see we either allow to take the Magboltz IDs for the
gases as listed in [[#sec:available_gases]] below or their names. The
names as strings are case insensitive.

Once a ~Magboltz~ object is defined all you need to do is run
~runMagboltz~ and it will call Magboltz for you. All files will be
stored in the ~outpath~ directory as given to ~initMagboltz~.

If you wish to run multiple processes in parallel, simply call
~runMagboltz~ with an array / seq input.

So for example:

#+begin_src nim
import nimboltz
let gases = initGases([("argon", 97.7), ("isobutane", 2.3)])
let mb = initMagboltz(gases, 1050.mbar, 300.K, 60.kV•cm⁻¹, nMax = 10,
                      usePenning = true, gasMotionThermal = true)
# to run a single calculation:
# runMagboltz(mb)
# to run multiple in parallel:
var mb1 = mb # to keep modifying it simple, we just copy...
var mb2 = mb
var mb3 = mb
var mb4 = mb
mb1.temp = 300.K # ... and reassign what we want changed
mb2.temp = 330.K
mb3.temp = 360.K
mb4.temp = 390.K
let mbs = [mb1, mb2, mb3, mb4]
runMagboltz(mbs)
#+end_src

In the future this will likely also provide some basic parsing of the
Magboltz output files, but not today. 

** Installing Magboltz

Download the Magboltz source code from here:

https://magboltz.web.cern.ch/magboltz/

Assuming you are on a Unix system, you might want to do:

#+begin_src sh
cd ~
mkdir -p src/Magboltz # for example for source code you compile
cd src/Magboltz
wget https://magboltz.web.cern.ch/magboltz/magboltz-11.17.f # for latest version as of writing
gfortran -O3 -o magboltz magboltz-11.17.f
#+end_src
which downloads and compiles Magboltz with optimizations enabled.

Then you should make sure to add =~/src/Magboltz= to your PATH, by adding
#+begin_src sh
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/src/Magboltz
#+end_src
to your =~/.bashrc=, =~/.zshrc= or wherever you store your terminal
configurations.

After starting a new terminal Magboltz should be available as
~magboltz~ from any directory.
